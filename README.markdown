# NMC Utility Belt

This is a collection of useful code and documentation created and shared by New Media Campaigns developers so we don't reinvent the wheel for every project.

## Organization

Please keep this repository well organized. For example, if you create a cool PHP class for integrating with the Salsa API, place your code in `/api/salsa/YourClass.php`.

## Documentation

Please document your code before adding it to the repository. The goal of this repository is to share code with others. So it is important that others be able to read your source code and associate documentation to get up and running fast. Inline PHPDoc comments are recommended.

I strongly encourage you to make sure you specify yourself as the author of your code using inline comments. This will make it easy for others to ask the original author questions about the code if necessary.
